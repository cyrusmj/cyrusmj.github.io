        <h3>For this assignment we were tasked to design and fabricate a 2-part silicon mold, then use that to cast identical items in plaster. </h3>
        <br />
        <br />
        Picking up from where I left off last week, I had to change some aspects of my design to place the candle lid while using the candle. 
        <br />

        <br />
        After completing the design (<a src="Mold/3dm/P2.3dm" style ="color:#FF7733">3dm file</a>), I created a .3x print. I used that to decided how the two pieces will be divided, designed and placed the halves into the mold boxes, and created opposite keys for each half. I continued by printing the parts (top piece: ~11 hours, bottom piece: ~ 6.5 hours). Here's a linked to the <a src="Mold/3dm/MoldTry2.3dm" style ="color:#FF7733">3dm</a>, <a src="Mold/stl/" style ="color:#FF7733">.stl</a>, and <a src="Mold/gcode" style ="color:#FF7733">gcode</a> files!

        <br />
        Then, I mixed my Oomoo and poured it into the models. After 6 hours I had two good looking molds ready to be casted.

        <br />
        I began casting the next morning, by mixing plaster with water.
        <br />
        Since I had left the two mold pieces on top if each other, they were very well stuck and I was able to use electrical tape to wrap them in place. I was then able to use my 3D printers shipping box as my casting workstation!

        However, I was only able to create a good replicate once due to:<br />
        1. Large footprint of my model with respect to how much plaster I had.<br />
        2. Position of the spruce. Ideally It wouldâ€™ve placed it on the bottom piece and sanded any over-during artifacts easily. <br />
        3. Skimping on plaster usage in round 2 & 3. <br />
