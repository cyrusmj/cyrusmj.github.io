        For this assignment we were tasked to:<br /><br />
        <h3> 1) Modify the mesh of two STLs to produce a single printable STL.</h3>
        For this part of the assignment, I decided to fix a problem in my silverware drawer. It’s was simply too <i>meshy!!</i> <br /><br />

        I started by looking on Thingiverse.com and picked out my favorite mix of solution and design to combine them. Then, I took the needed measurement for size adjustment! <br />

        <br />
        I wanted to use the first design for the top portion of my final design (original design on <a href=https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:36085 style ="color:#FF7733">Thingiverse</a>), but needed to adjust to the width to make sure my silverware don’t fall over. Then I proceeded by removing the legs from the second design (original files on <a href=https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2752056 style ="color:#FF7733">Thingiverse</a>), and filling the holes and surfaces that became exposed.<br />
        Once I was happy with the individual pieces, I continued by aligning them, then joining, and finally reducing mesh numbers.<br/>
        After couple of minor tweaks, now I’m happy reduced <i>mesh</i> in my my silverware drawer!!

        <h3>2) Make a start on a lamp!</h3>
        
        My journey for deciding what elements to use for this design and what the design is going to be has been long, but certainly far from being complete … Here’s the progress so far!<br /><br />
        
        I finally found the light bulb I’m designing for, but my friend has it since I was planning on returning it IKEA due to the amount of light it outputs! <br />
        But, I’m keeping the light bulb now that I can control the amount of light emitting through this light by designing the perfect lamp(well, hopefully!) <br />
        Light bulb size is approximately 200mmX400mm.<br />

        I’ve identified the main piece of my design, which is the Farsi letter و(v). And I’m committed to use grasshopper for most (if not all) of my design. <br/>
        <img src="Lamp/images/Vav.png" height="400" align="middle"><br /><br /> 
        
        I started by creating its shape in Adobe Ai, and imported it into Rhino. The design idea I’m pursuing right now is using this letter as a way to join two polygon surfaces shown in the sketches below. Sizes and angles required are also shown in that sketch based on the measurements for the light bulb. <br />

        So far here’s a screenshot of where things are currently at!<br />
