        For this assignment we were tasked to:<br/>
        <h3> 1) Assemble our 3D printers and document the process here: </h3>
        In order to assemble my 3D printer (Creality Ender Pro 5 with Silent Board), I watched <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5ZGnME7JNw  style ="color:#FF7733"> this YouTube video</a>, and followed the process noted in the manual (2hrs). <br />
        I proceeded by printing several failed attempts of <a href=https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4130721 style ="color:#FF7733"> this test patterns</a> that I thought were due to bed leveling, loose screws, and improper extrusion (3hrs)!<br /> 
        Once I was able to print a bed level test, I wanted to print the pre-loaded lucky cat! Several hours of failed attempts and browsing Reddit later, I realized that my 3D printer needs a firmware update to change zstep/mm to 800, and fix several other bugs, but I didn’t have a Mini-USB … Who uses Mini-USB anymore Creality?!? <br />
        Many hours (4+) later, I happily printed the lucky cat model (some failed attempts next to my lucky print). <br /><br />

        <br />
        <br />
        <br />

        
        
        <h3> 2) Using Rhino and Cura create, print, and document the following tests:
        - A 2cm cube with the standard 'low quality' settings and a brim <br />
        - A 2cm cube with the standard 'standard quality' settings and a brim <br />
        - A 2cm cube with the standard 'high quality' settings and a brim <br />
        - A 2cm cube with a concentric top and bottom layer</h3>
        
        I began this section by designing a simple cube in <a href=https://github.com/cyrusmj/cyrusmj.github.io/tree/master/A2/3dm style ="color:#FF7733"> Rhino</a>, exported it to <a href=https://github.com/cyrusmj/cyrusmj.github.io/tree/master/A2/stl style ="color:#FF7733"> .stl</a>, and imported to Cura, where I changed the quality, added a brim, and at the end printed one with standard setting and changed the infill to concentric <a href=https://github.com/cyrusmj/cyrusmj.github.io/tree/master/A2/gcode style ="color:#FF7733"> gcodes here</a>! <br />
        All printed with a total time matching the Cura predicted time + (2-4) min, which I attributed to the warm up time for bed and nozzle. <br />
        Interestingly, as I increased the quality, actual print size seemed to get closer to the designed amount. <br /><br />
        
        Times: <br />
        - Low quality cube: Cura = 20 min, Actual = 23 min <br />
        <img src="A2/images/Low.png" height="400" align="middle"> <br /><br />
        - Standard quality cube: Cura = 24 min, Actual = 28 min <br />
        <img src="A2/images/Med.png" height="400" align="middle"> <br /><br />
        - High quality cube: Cura = 43 min, Actual = 47 min <br />
        <img src="A2/images/High.png" height="400" align="middle"> <br /><br />
        - Standard Concentric Cube: Cura = 24 min, Actual 27 min <br />
        <img src="A2/images/MedConc.png" height="400" align="middle"> <br /><br />
        <br />
        
        
        <h3> - A tube 2cm in diameter and .5cm high with a single extrusion wall thickness<br />
        - A tube 2cm in diameter and .5cm high with a double extrusion wall thickness and random z-seam alignment</h3>
        
        Once I was happy with my cubes, I proceeded to design the tube in <a href=https://github.com/cyrusmj/cyrusmj.github.io/tree/master/A2/3dm style ="color:#FF7733"> Rhino</a>,, exported it to <a href=https://github.com/cyrusmj/cyrusmj.github.io/tree/master/A2/stl style ="color:#FF7733"> .stl</a>, and imported to Cura, where I changed Wall Line Count to 1, and then to 2 and set Z-Seam Alignment to Random to create these <a href=https://github.com/cyrusmj/cyrusmj.github.io/tree/master/A2/gcode style ="color:#FF7733"> gcodes</a>. <br />
        Both prints were done within 4 min tolerance of the expected time, which was due to the warm up time.<br />
        One interesting observation was that the actual measurement seemed to get closer to the designed diameter, but I couldn’t take very accurate measurements here since print was very thin! <br /><br />
        
        Times: <br />
        - Single extrusion tube: Cura = 2 min, Actual= 6 min<br />
        <img src="A2/images/SingleRing.png" height="400" align="middle"> <br /><br />
        - Double extrusion tube: Cura = 4min, Actual= 8 min<br />
        <img src="A2/images/DoubleRing.png" height="400" align="middle"> <br /><br />
        <br />
        
        <h3> - A tube 2cm in diameter and .5cm high with a single extrusion wall thickness<br />
        - A tube 2cm in diameter and .5cm high with a double extrusion wall thickness and random z-seam alignment</h3>
        
        For this step I decided to fill my 3D model in <a href=https://github.com/cyrusmj/cyrusmj.github.io/tree/master/A2/3dm style ="color:#FF7733"> Rhino</a>, exported it to <a href=https://github.com/cyrusmj/cyrusmj.github.io/tree/master/A2/stl style ="color:#FF7733"> .stl</a> twice with the tolerance instructions noted above, opened in Cura and turned the first model on its side and added supports. <br />
        Similar to the previous prints, print times were very close, but rotated print took more than double the time to print compared to the normal cylinder due to its print structure. <br/> <br />
        
        Times: <br />
        - Standard Cylinder: Cura = 7 min, Actual = 9 min <br/>
        <img src="A2/images/Cyl.png" height="400" align="middle"> <br /><br />
        - Side Rotated Cylinder with higher tolerance: Cura 19 min, Actual = 22 min <br/>
        <img src="A2/images/CylHighTol.png" height="400" align="middle"> <br /><br />
        <br />
        <br />
        
        <h3>3) After we ensure our 3D printer is calibrated and works properly using the steps above, we were tasked to design and print a 20.0mm +/- 0.5mm cube with a 5.0mm +/- 0.5mm hole through it.</h3>
        I was able to finally design this piece in <a href=https://github.com/cyrusmj/cyrusmj.github.io/tree/master/A2/3dm style ="color:#FF7733"> Rhino</a>, get it sliced in Cura by exporting to <a href=https://github.com/cyrusmj/cyrusmj.github.io/tree/master/A2/stl style ="color:#FF7733"> .stl</a>, and print it <a href=https://github.com/cyrusmj/cyrusmj.github.io/tree/master/A2/gcode style ="color:#FF7733"> (gcode)</a> without issues on the first try! <br /> 
        Again, time was in the same (2-4) min as noted above, so it took 32 min to print when the expected print time was 30 min. <br />

        And finally, they all posed for an A2 Family Photo!!<br/>
