        For this assignment we were tasked to:<br /><br />
        <h3> 1) Assemble our 3D printers and document the process here: </h3>
        In order to assemble my 3D printer (Creality Ender Pro 5 with Silent Board), I watched <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5ZGnME7JNw  style ="color:#FF7733"> this YouTube video</a>, and followed the process noted in the manual (2hrs). <br />
        I proceeded by printing several failed attempts of <a href=https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4130721 style ="color:#FF7733"> this test patterns</a> that I thought were due to bed leveling, loose screws, and improper extrusion (3hrs)!<br /> 
        Once I was able to print a bed level test, I wanted to print the pre-loaded lucky cat! Several hours of failed attempts and browsing Reddit later, I realized that my 3D printer needs a firmware update to change zstep/mm to 800, and fix several other bugs, but I didn’t have a Mini-USB … Who uses Mini-USB anymore Creality?!? <br />
        Many hours (4+) later, I happily printed the lucky cat model (some failed attempts next to my lucky print). <br /><br />

        <h3> 2) Using Rhino and Cura create, print, and document the following tests: <br />
        - A 2cm cube with the standard 'low quality' settings and a brim <br />
        - A 2cm cube with the standard 'standard quality' settings and a brim <br />
        - A 2cm cube with the standard 'high quality' settings and a brim <br />
        - A 2cm cube with a concentric top and bottom layer <br /> </h3>
        
        I decided to create my shapes based on the PacMan game characters, so first step was importing this PacMan family photo! <br />
        <img src="A1/SS/Family-0.png" height="400" align="middle">  
        <br />
        <br />
        
        From here, I blew up the image size, grabbed screenshots of my favorite characters, and imported them into Adobe Illustrator shown below:<br />
        <img src="A1/SS/Pacman-0.png" height="400" align="middle"> 
        <img src="A1/SS/Blinky-0.png" height="400" align="middle">         
        <img src="A1/SS/Weird-0.png" height="400" align="middle"> 
        <br />
        <br />
        
        I continued that by turning the images to B&W and tracing them like shown below. <a href=https://github.com/cyrusmj/cyrusmj.github.io/tree/master/A1/Ai  style ="color:#FF7733"> Adobe illustrator files</a> <br />
        Micro steps taken here were: Invert color + Selective coloring + Levels + B&W + Contrast + Filter->Blur + Image trace<br />
        <img src="A1/SS/Pacman-2.png" height="400" align="middle"> 
        <img src="A1/SS/Blinky-2.png" height="400" align="middle">         
        <img src="A1/SS/Weird-2.png" height="400" align="middle"> 
        <br />
        <br />
        
        Once the images were traced, I exported them as <a href=https://github.com/cyrusmj/cyrusmj.github.io/tree/master/A1/dxf  style ="color:#FF7733"> dxf files</a> to use in Rhino! They looked like these in Rhino:
        <br />
        <img src="A1/SS/Pacman-3.png" height="400" align="middle"> 
        <img src="A1/SS/Blinky-3.png" height="400" align="middle">         
        <img src="A1/SS/Weird-3.png" height="400" align="middle">    
        <br />
        <br />
    
        But I somehow didn’t like how they turned out with the pixelated look, so I “exploded” and “Rebuilt” my models with fewer points and started moving the curves around to create some interesting shapes that I liked. <br /> 
        Once I was happy with everything I turned them into solid models files shown here:
        <a href=https://github.com/cyrusmj/cyrusmj.github.io/tree/master/A1/3dm style ="color:#FF7733"> 3dm files</a> and 
        <a href=https://github.com/cyrusmj/cyrusmj.github.io/tree/master/A1/stl  style ="color:#FF7733"> .stl files</a>
        <br />
        <img src="A1/SS/Pacman-4.png" height="400" align="middle">  
        <img src="A1/SS/Blinky-4.png" height="400" align="middle">         
        <img src="A1/SS/Weird-4.png" height="400" align="middle">  
        <br />
        <br />
        
        And now they’re 3 happy cookie cutters ready to be 3D printed. Here's a picture of them posing for another family photoshoot!<br />
        <a href=https://github.com/cyrusmj/cyrusmj.github.io/tree/master/A1/stl/PACMAN-CC.stl  style ="color:#FF7733"> Here's a link</a> to the family photo file for your download :)
