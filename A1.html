    <h3>Project Goal</h3>
	<p>
        For this assignment we were tasked to create 3 different cookie cutters by:<br />
        1) Importing shapes from images<br />
        2) Import those shapes into Rhino<br />
        3) Lastly, build a solid model using those curves <br />
        <br />
        
        <h3>My Steps </h3>
        I decided to create my shapes based on the PacMan game characters, so first step was importing this PacMan family photo! <br />
        <img src="A1/SS/Family-0.png" height="400" align="middle">  
        <br />
        <br />
        
        From here, I blew up the image size, grabbed screenshots of my favorite characters, and imported them into Adobe Illustrator shown below:<br />
        <img src="A1/SS/Pacman-0.png" height="400" align="middle"> 
        <img src="A1/SS/Blinky-0.png" height="400" align="middle">         
        <img src="A1/SS/Weird-0.png" height="400" align="middle"> 
        <br />
        <br />
        
        I continued that by turning the images to B&W and tracing them like shown below. <a href=https://github.com/cyrusmj/cyrusmj.github.io/tree/master/A1/Ai  style ="color:#FF7733"> Adobe illustrator files</a> <br />
        Micro steps taken here were: Invert color + Selective coloring + Levels + B&W + Contrast + Filter->Blur + Image trace<br />
        <img src="A1/SS/Pacman-2.png" height="400" align="middle"> 
        <img src="A1/SS/Blinky-2.png" height="400" align="middle">         
        <img src="A1/SS/Weird-2.png" height="400" align="middle"> 
        <br />
        <br />
        
        Once the images were traced, I exported them as <a href=https://github.com/cyrusmj/cyrusmj.github.io/tree/master/A1/dxf  style ="color:#FF7733"> dxf files</a> to use in Rhino! They looked like these in Rhino:
        <br />
        <img src="A1/SS/Pacman-3.png" height="400" align="middle"> 
        <img src="A1/SS/Blinky-3.png" height="400" align="middle">         
        <img src="A1/SS/Weird-3.png" height="400" align="middle">    
        <br />
        <br />
    
        But I somehow didn’t like how they turned out with the pixelated look, so I “exploded” and “Rebuilt” my models with fewer points and started moving the curves around to create some interesting shapes that I liked. <br /> 
        Once I was happy with everything I turned them into solid models files shown here:
        <a href=https://github.com/cyrusmj/cyrusmj.github.io/tree/master/A1/3dm style ="color:#FF7733"> 3dm files</a> and 
        <a href=https://github.com/cyrusmj/cyrusmj.github.io/tree/master/A1/stl  style ="color:#FF7733"> .stl files</a>
        <br />
        <img src="A1/SS/Pacman-4.png" height="400" align="middle">  
        <img src="A1/SS/Blinky-4.png" height="400" align="middle">         
        <img src="A1/SS/Weird-4.png" height="400" align="middle">  
        <br />
        <br />
        
        And now they’re 3 happy cookie cutters ready to be 3D printed. Here's a picture of them posing for another family photoshoot!<br />
