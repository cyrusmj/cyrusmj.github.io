    <h2> About me </h2>
			<p>
	Hi Class! <br />
			<br />
			My name is Cyrus and I'm a Cockpit UX Design Engineer at Boeing. <br />
			I've always been passionate about creating functional designs, but have only had a chance to learn and apply the display based ones! Now excited to learn how to design and prototype some physical prototypes here; hopefully integrate them with some interesting digital pieces! <br />
			I'm also doing my capstone right now, and interested to learn how I can design the physical enclosure of our prototype focusing on non-visual navigation for blind and low-vision individuals.<br />
			Not sure what exactly I can teach the class, but here to learn from all and be more than happy to share what I know! <br />
			<br />
			Looking forward to meeting with all of you virtually and collaborating on some cool ideas!
			</p>
