	<p>
	    For this assignment we were tasked to create a proposal pitch for our final project that includes:
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>1) A concept, including concept sketches, intended use case, context </h3>
        Since I moved to my place, I haven’t had enough time to put my outdoor space together. Because of COVID-19, I’ve decided to design and build it myself after graduation (this quarter!!) 
        <br />
        This space (pictured with measurements below) is on my top floor, so I’d like to minimize my moving efforts and create a detailed design plan prior to purchasing, carrying, and moving any item.
        <br />
        Another objective of mine is to practice joining/merging separate surfaces in Rhino since that’s been a troubling area for me in the past.

        <br />
        
       
        <h3>2) A breakdown of tasks </h3>
        <strong> My end goal is to:</strong><br />
        - Create CAD model of this space <br />
        - Design and place the furniture <br />
        - 3D print the mockups  <br />
        - Extra credit: Realistic rendering <br />
        *All above will be done at 0.05x ratio <br />
        <br />
        <br />
       
        <h3>3) A timeline with contingency plans</h3>
        <strong>Week 1: </strong> <br />
        - Perform measurements<br />
        - Create the space without furniture<br />
        - 3D print the space without furniture<br />
        - Order parts<br />
        <strong>Week 2:</strong><br />
        - Design the furniture<br />
        - 3D print and place the furniture<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>4) A bill of material with sourcing schedule</h3>
        Since the only material I need is colored filament, I’m estimating the material cost to be ~$20.
        <br/> 
        I’m currently deciding between these 3 links below for ordering colored PLA! Any thoughts would be appreciated!
