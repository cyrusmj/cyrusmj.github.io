	    Brief description of my <a href="A7.html" style ="color:#FF7733;">A7: Final project proposal</a>
        Because of COVID-19, I decided to design and build the furniture needed for my outdoor space after graduation! But this space (pictured with measurements below) is on 4th floor. <br/>
        So, I decided to minimize my moving efforts, and create a detailed design (1/20th ratio) prior to purchasing and carrying items for my final project. Another objective of mine with this effort is to practice joining/merging separate surfaces in Rhino since that’s been a troubling area for me in the past. <br/>

        <br/><br/><br/>
        I began this project by modeling the layout of the space, and extruded the walls based on measurements.<br/>
        <img src="Final/images/Layout.png" height="500" align="middle"><br/><br/>
        Then, I modeled the floor in Grasshopper, and shaped it to the layout.<br/>
        <img src="Final/images/Base.png" height="500" align="middle"><br/><br/>
        From here, big picture was complete and I started transitioning to the lower level details.<br/>
        I began by modeling the pieces that already exist. First, I modeled the AC, hammock frame, grill, and railing behind the grill. <br/>
        The only piece I had trouble with modeling was the hammock frame, which I found a model on <a href=https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2928146 style ="color:#FF7733">Thingiverse</a>. <br/>

        <img src="Final/images/Hammock.png" height="500" align="middle">
        <br/><br/><br/>
        Then I started searching for a shading solution and found <a href=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DBL3RHM/ref=cm_sw_r_sms_awdb_t1_I3h0EbRKT1P0G style ="color:#FF7733">this Link</a>, and modeled it based on measurements found!<br/>

        <br/><br/><br/>
        For the seating, which was the only remaining item, I decided to take measurements from my couch, and create a modular design that’d allow me to move pieces around as needed. <br/>
        I also used the same base design for tables. <br/>

        <img src="Final/images/Table.png" height="500" align="middle">
        <br/><br/><br/>
        Then, my model was complete! <strong>Woohoo!!</strong> <br/>
        Here is an images of my finished model <br/>
        <img src="Final/images/Furnished.png" height="500" align="middle">
        <br/><br/><br/>
        I also 3D printed the entire model! To create this entire space, 29 individually printed pieces came together! <br/>
